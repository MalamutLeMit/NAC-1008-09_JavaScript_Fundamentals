# NAC-1008-09_JAVASCRIPT_FUNDAMENTALS

This project contains a series of JavaScript exercises organized by topic, along with Jest tests to validate the solutions.

## Dependencies Installation

Before you begin, ensure that **Node.js** is installed on your system. All necessary dependencies, including Jest, are already listed in the project configuration. To install the dependencies, run:

`npm install`

## Viewing console.log() Output

To view the output of the **console.log()** statements in any of the exercises, you can directly run the JavaScript file in your terminal using the following command:

`node path/to/file.js`

_Note: The exact path to each file (path/to/file.js) is provided in the corresponding exercise file, making it easy to locate and run the specific exercise youâ€™re working on._


## Running Tests

This project uses Jest for testing. The tests are designed to verify that the console.log() statements produce the expected outputs and that variables and values are correctly set according to the exercise instructions.

_Note: The exact command (npm run test:X.X.X) is provided in each exercise file, so you can easily locate and run the specific test you need._

To run the Jest test associated with a specific exercise, use the appropriate npm script with the following command:
